I am partially unsatisfied with where I am right now, but I think it’s not necessarily a bad thing, as it motivates me to improve myself. So, I will take a little bit of time every day to read and/or code things that I am interested in. In the field of AI, I am most interested in how to build trustworthy AI, so this includes topics like fairness, explainability, privacy, etc. But I’m also interested in other fields, such as particle physics and neuroscience. So I should challenge myself to improve my knowledge in those fields as well. I will try my best to log my journey daily, but I don’t want to put too much pressure on myself. I’ll keep reminding myself that something is better than nothing, and at least I’m slowly leveling up.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="challenge"/><category term="challenge,"/><category term="reading,"/><category term="coding"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new challenge I set up for myself.]]></summary></entry></feed>
