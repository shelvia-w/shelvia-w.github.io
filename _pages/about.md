I am currently pursuing a PhD at the National University of Singapore, specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), under the supervision of Professor Mehul Motani. My primary research focus centers on using information theory to enhance our understanding in deep learning and improve performance. My research areas in deep learning include generalization, explainability, and fairness, all of which are important to ensure the reliability of AI models before deployment, especially in safety-critical domains such as healthcare. I love engaging in cutting-edge research discussions and thinking about innovative ways to propel the field of AI to new heights. I consistently keep up with the latest developments in AI research, which is necessary given how rapid the field is progressing. In addition to my AI research, I also have a strong interest in particle physics and neuroscience.
