I am currently pursuing a PhD at the National University of Singapore, specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), under the supervision of Professor Mehul Motani. My primary research focus centers on using information theory to enhance our understanding in deep learning and improve performance. My research areas in deep learning include generalization, explainability, and fairness, all of which are important to ensure the reliability of a model before deployment, especially in safety-critical domains. I am passionate about engaging in cutting-edge research discussions and constantly seeking out innovative avenues to propel the field of AI to new heights. I am consistently keeping up with the latest developments in AI, in a steadfast effort to stay at the vanguard of advancements in this dynamic field. In addition to my AI research, I also have a strong interest in particle physics and neuroscience.
