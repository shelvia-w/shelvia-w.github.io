✏️ Author: Benjamin Stevenson
📅 Published date: 29 March 2022
📅 Dates read: 21 December 2023 - 10 January 2024
⭐ My rating: 4/5
📝 Comments: The story-telling style is very interesting and I really enjoyed this book. The plot twist was alright, sufficient hints were scattered around the book. But I wasn't a big fan of the ending.
💬 Quotes:
- Family is not whose blood runs in your veins, it's who you'd spill it for.
- If a killer is ever revealed and your ‘percentage read’ isn’t at least in the high eighties, they cannot be the real killer; there is simply too much of the book still to be read.
