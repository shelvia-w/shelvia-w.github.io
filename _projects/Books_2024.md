📝 Comments: The story-telling style is very interesting and I really enjoyed this book. The plot twist was alright, sufficient hints were scattered around the book. But I wasn't a big fan of the ending.

💬 Quotes:
- Family is not whose blood runs in your veins, it's who you'd spill it for.
- If a killer is ever revealed and your ‘percentage read’ isn’t at least in the high eighties, they cannot be the real killer; there is simply too much of the book still to be read.

⭐ My rating: 3/5

📝 Comments: I came to know about this book from BookTok, but perhaps I'm just too old for young, sweet romance. The story was sad and beautiful though.

💬 Quotes:
- Why does it take a life ending to learn how to cherish each day? Why must we wait until we run out of time to start to accomplish all that we dreamed, when once we had all the time in the world? Why don’t we look at the person we love the most like it’s the last time we will ever see them? Because if we did, life would be so vibrant. Life would be so truly and completely lived.
- She was my cherry blossom. An unrivaled beauty, limited in its life. A beauty so extreme in its grace that it can't last. It stays to enrich our lives, then drifts away in the wind. Never forgotten. Because it reminds us we must live. That life is fragile, yet in that fragility, there is strength. There is love. There is purpose. It reminds us that life is short, that our breaths are numbered and our destiny is fixed, regardless of how hard we fight. It reminds us not to waste a single second. Live hard, love harder. Chase dreams, seek adventures...capture moments. Live beautifully.

**3. [Five Survive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61313902-five-survive?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=fbw4OcDZTr&rank=1)**
