I'm currently taking on a challenge to conduct user experience and market research for Valorant cosmetics. While it's a bit different from the research I'm used to, I believe there's no harm in trying. I love research in general, especially when it involves a bit of psychology. Plus, I enjoy learning new things, and I've realized that I really like this kind of research too. Who knows what my knowledge in AI can contribute to this field!

### Work in Progress:
- [Research Notes](https://github.com/shelvia-w/Valorant-Cosmetics/blob/main/report/Valorant%20Cosmetics%20Research%20Notes.pdf)
- [Research Report](https://github.com/shelvia-w/Valorant-Cosmetics/blob/main/report/Valorant%20Cosmetics%20Research%20Report.pdf)

### Updates:
March 20, 2024: I’ve finished familiarizing myself with Valorant cosmetics and have read up on user experience and market research. Next, I’ll focus on extracting relevant statistics about the product and gathering data on users' opinions.
