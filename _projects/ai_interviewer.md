I’m currently working on a challenge to build an AI interviewer that helps me prepare for job interviews. The goal of this AI interviewer is to simulate interview process and provide feedback. Here’s my idea:

A personalized AI interview coach that helps users improve their interview skills. It begins by asking the user for the role or job they are targeting and, if available, requests a job description and required qualifications. This allows it to tailor interview questions and feedback with precision.

It simulates realistic interview scenarios by asking relevant questions based on the role, industry, and the user’s experience level. After each response, it offers detailed, constructive feedback focusing on structure, content, clarity, tone, and confidence. It can provide model answers, improvement strategies, and guidance on how to communicate effectively and highlight strengths.

This GPT supports a wide range of interview formats including behavioral, technical, case-based, and role-specific scenarios. It keeps the tone professional yet encouraging, ensuring feedback is supportive, actionable, and never generic. Follow-up questions are used to help the user reflect and deepen their responses.

If the user is uncertain about their target role, the GPT offers suggestions. It helps users develop their personal pitch, manage nerves, and build interview fluency. The GPT is designed to adapt throughout a session to the user's goals and background, and requests updated context if the user changes roles.

### Mock Interview

I provided the role and qualifications to the GPT:

Role: ML Specialist, Trust and Safety

Our Trust & Safety team's commitment is to keep our online community safe. We have invested heavily in human and machine based moderation to remove harmful content quickly and often before it reaches our general community. As an ML Specialist, you will be responsible for training our global AI models (CV, OCR, NLP, Audio, Multimodel) to ensure accurate and efficient detection of unsafe content. You will work with the algorithm engineers, the data labelling team and the product & process team to design and improve machine learning model operation processes. This role is crucial in ensuring the quality and relevancy of input into the model which will impact the overall safety of our users.

Responsibilities:
1. Collaborate with algo R&D and engineers to manage and optimise model service stability, ensuring stability of model lifecycle operation.
2. Monitor and report on model performance, identify areas for improvement and implement necessary adjustments via solid root causes analyses.
3. Responsible for resource management and planning of machine learning resources, including: cost and budget, resource efficiency enhancement, offline and online resources tides, etc.

Minimum Qualifications:
1. Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Data Science, Data Analytics or a related field. An advanced degree(Master's, PhD) is preferred.
2. Extensive experience in machine learning, data science, and data governance. Proven experience in implementing MLOps processes is a plus.
3. Passionate about technology, product and innovation; Solid knowledge of ML models (e.g. CV, NLP, OCR, Audio, Multimodel) and frameworks(e.g. few-shot learning etc); Proficiency in SQL and Python; Prior experience with pre-trained models like CLIP is a plus.
4. Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
5. Good communication skills and enjoy working with diverse teams globally.

I compiled the list of interview questions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Rulz2oXngoDYnpxFMv2ABu6334PhrOlNUCP8eI8WV8/edit?usp=sharing). Here's a little snippet:

Question 1:
Tell me about a time when you improved the performance or stability of a machine learning model in production. What was the context, what actions did you take, and what were the results?

I gave my answer, and then it responded by:
- Complimenting what I did well
- Pointing out areas for improvement
- Offering an improved version of my answer
- Explaining why the sample answer works well

Overall, I think I could definitely gain a lot from this virtual training. It helps me structure my thought process while also boosting my technical knowledge along the way.

### Preview
Here's a preview of the website:

### Updates:
- Tested the AI interviewer using custom GPT.
- In the progress of prototyping the website.
