#### ‚ú® Vibe Coding Challenge

I'm so excited to be starting a new challenge called: A to Z Vibe Coding. This challenge is largely inspired by Alexander Tingstr√∂m's [30 Days of Vibe](https://30daysofvibe.com/). Be sure to check out his amazing work! I decided to take a slightly different approach: each project title is based on a letter of the alphabet (I might start from a random letter). And at the end, I‚Äôm planning to include 4 bonus projects (marked with card suit icons), which will be a bit more challenging than the others.

I really love mixing AI with design and finding creative ways to bring the two together. Through these side projects, I like playing at the intersection of logic and creativity.


#### üëÄ Preview
Here's a preview of the website (it's vibe coded btw since I have little experience building a website):
