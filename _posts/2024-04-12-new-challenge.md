This is rather random, but as my PhD journey is coming close to an end, I would like to challenge myself with reading and coding. I am partially unsatisfied with where I am right now, but I think itâ€™s not necessarily a bad thing, as it motivates me to improve myself. So, I will take a little bit of time every day to read and/or code things that I am interested in. In the field of AI, I am most interested in how to build trustworthy AI, so this includes topics like fairness, explainability, privacy, etc. But Iâ€™m also interested in other fields, such as particle physics and neuroscience. So I should challenge myself to improve my knowledge in those fields as well. I will try my best to log my journey daily, but I donâ€™t want to put too much pressure on myself. Iâ€™ll keep reminding myself that something is better than nothing, and at least Iâ€™m slowly leveling up.
